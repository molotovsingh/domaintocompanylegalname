# Project History: Evolution of the Domain Intelligence Platform

This folder preserves important historical documents that show the evolution of the Domain Intelligence Platform from its initial conception to its current state.

## üìÖ Timeline

### June 23, 2025: Genesis
- **Document**: `Original-Project-Specification-June-2025.md`
- **Vision**: Simple domain-to-company name extractor for 1 million domains
- **Technology**: BeautifulSoup, Redis queues, Docker containers
- **Goal**: 85% accuracy in 24-48 hours

### June 2025 - August 2025: Rapid Evolution
The project transformed from a simple web scraper into a comprehensive business intelligence platform:

1. **Architecture Evolution**
   - From: Single BeautifulSoup scraper
   - To: Federated microservices (Playwright, Scrapy, Crawlee, Axios+Cheerio)

2. **Philosophy Shift**
   - From: Finding "the" company name (1:1 mapping)
   - To: Claims-based approach (1:many mapping with confidence scores)

3. **Data Source Enhancement**
   - From: Basic HTML scraping
   - To: GLEIF integration for authoritative legal entity data

4. **Intelligence Layer**
   - From: Regex and parsing rules
   - To: LLM-enhanced extraction and arbitration

5. **Business Focus**
   - From: Technical tool for name extraction
   - To: Solution for complex domain-to-entity mapping problem

## üìÅ Documents in This Folder

### Original Specifications
- **Original-Project-Specification-June-2025.md** - The first blueprint that started it all

### Future Additions
This folder will grow to include:
- Major milestone documents
- Architecture decision records
- Platform evolution snapshots
- User feedback compilations

## üéØ Purpose

Understanding where we came from helps us appreciate:
- How user needs shaped the platform
- Why certain architectural decisions were made
- The complexity of the problem we're solving
- The iterative nature of software development

## üí° Key Insight

The most significant evolution wasn't technical‚Äîit was philosophical. The realization that domain-to-entity mapping is inherently a 1-to-many relationship transformed a simple scraper into an intelligence platform that presents multiple valid claims for user arbitration.
