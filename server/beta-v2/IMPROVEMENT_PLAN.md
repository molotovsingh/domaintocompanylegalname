# Beta V2 Federation Architecture Improvement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines improvements to the Beta V2 federated architecture that maintain complete service independence while establishing voluntary consistency patterns.

## Core Principles (Must Maintain)
- ✅ Each service remains completely independent
- ✅ No shared code dependencies between services
- ✅ Services can evolve at their own pace
- ✅ Changes to one service don't affect others

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation Standards (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish clear documentation patterns for each service

1. **Service API Documentation**
   - Each service creates its own `API.md` file
   - Document all endpoints, request/response formats
   - Include example usage
   - Priority: High (improves developer experience)

2. **Error Response Guidelines**
   - Create `CONVENTIONS.md` in beta-v2 root (guidelines only)
   - Recommended error format:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Human-readable message",
     "code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE",
     "details": {} // Optional context
   }
   ```
   - Services adopt voluntarily

### Phase 2: Observability (Week 2)
**Goal**: Improve monitoring and debugging capabilities

1. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - Each service adds `/health` endpoint
   - Standard response format:
   ```json
   {
     "service": "ServiceName",
     "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "timestamp": "ISO 8601 date",
     "uptime": 12345 // seconds
   }
   ```

2. **Logging Standards**
   - Pattern: `[Beta v2] [ServiceName] [Component] message`
   - Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
   - Each service implements independently

### Phase 3: Configuration Management (Week 3)
**Goal**: Standardize configuration handling

1. **Service Configuration Files**
   - Each service creates `config.ts`
   - Environment variable handling
   - Default values
   - Validation

2. **Status Value Conventions**
   - Document standard statuses in `CONVENTIONS.md`
   - Common: `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`
   - Services use relevant subset

### Phase 4: Metrics & Monitoring (Week 4)
**Goal**: Enable performance tracking

1. **Processing Metrics**
   - Track per service:
     - Total requests
     - Success/failure rates
     - Average processing time
     - Last processed timestamp

2. **Metrics Endpoint**
   - Each service adds `/metrics` endpoint
   - JSON format for easy consumption
   - No external dependencies

## Service-Specific Improvements

- [ ] Create config.ts

### Crawlee Service
- [ ] Add API.md documentation
- [ ] Implement health endpoint
- [ ] Standardize error responses
- [ ] Add metrics tracking
- [ ] Create config.ts

### Playwright Service
- [ ] Add API.md documentation
- [ ] Implement health endpoint
- [ ] Standardize error responses
- [ ] Add metrics tracking
- [ ] Create config.ts
- [ ] Fix standalone server issues

### Scrapy Service
- [ ] Add API.md documentation
- [ ] Implement health endpoint
- [ ] Standardize error responses
- [ ] Add metrics tracking
- [ ] Create config.ts
- [ ] Migrate to storage class pattern

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Incremental Adoption**
   - Services adopt improvements when convenient
   - No coordinated releases required
   - Backwards compatibility maintained

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Each service tests independently
   - No cross-service integration tests
   - Focus on service-specific reliability

3. **Documentation First**
   - Document patterns before implementation
   - Update docs as patterns evolve
   - Keep examples current

## Success Metrics

- Developer Experience: Easier to understand and use services
- Debugging: Faster issue identification and resolution
- Consistency: Similar patterns reduce cognitive load
- Independence: Zero increase in service coupling

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Creating shared libraries
- ❌ Enforcing standards through code
- ❌ Cross-service dependencies
- ❌ Centralized configuration
- ❌ Unified database schema

## Timeline

- Week 1: Documentation standards
- Week 2: Health checks and logging
- Week 3: Configuration management
- Week 4: Metrics implementation
- Ongoing: Service-specific improvements as needed

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create CONVENTIONS.md with guidelines
3. Start with one service as example
4. Let other services adopt patterns organically
