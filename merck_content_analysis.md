## Level 1 Extraction Improvements Needed

### 1. Hero Section Text Analysis

### 2. About Section Deep Mining
**Current**: Separate about page requests (all 404'd)
**Improved**: On-page about content analysis from main page

### 3. Industry Context Recognition
**Current**: Generic domain parsing
**Improved**: Industry-specific pattern recognition (pharmaceutical, biotech keywords)

### 4. Corporate Scale Indicators
**Current**: Basic company name extraction
**Improved**: Fortune 500 scale recognition, heritage timeline analysis

### 5. Content Hierarchy Weighting
**Current**: Meta properties beat footer copyright (80% vs 75%)
**Improved**: Primary messaging should score 90%+, corporate descriptions 85%+

## Recommendations for Extraction Enhancement

1. **Add Hero Section Parsing**: Extract main headlines and taglines
2. **Industry-Specific Patterns**: Recognize pharmaceutical/biotech terminology
3. **Corporate Heritage Detection**: Look for timeline indicators ("130 years", "established", etc.)
4. **Business Description Mining**: Target corporate mission and positioning statements
5. **Content Hierarchy Scoring**: Weight primary messaging higher than meta tags

The current Level 1 extraction captured basic entity identification but missed the rich corporate intelligence available on the main page content.
