*Created: July 12, 2025 at 2:52 AM UTC*

This folder contains all project documentation organized by purpose and timeline.

## Folder Structure

### **`/current/`**
Active, up-to-date documentation for the Domain Intelligence Platform.

**Contents:**
- Main project documentation and user preferences
- Current API endpoints and usage guides
- User guides for platform features
- Current system architecture overview

**Purpose:** Keep only the most current, actively used documentation. Historical or outdated docs should be moved to appropriate archive folders.

### **`/journey/`**
Documents the evolution and development journey of the platform.

**Purpose:**
- Help future developers understand project evolution
- Major milestones and turning points
- Challenges faced and overcome
- Key decisions and their rationale

**Suggested Contents:**
- Timeline of project evolution
- Major achievements and breakthroughs
- Problems encountered and solutions found
- How features and architecture evolved

## Documentation Philosophy

### **Current vs Historical**
- **Current**: Active documentation that users and developers reference regularly
- **Journey**: Historical context showing how we got here
- **Archived**: Detailed technical analysis and research (see `/archived/design-docs/`)

### **Maintenance Strategy**
- Regular review of `/current/` for accuracy
- Move outdated documentation to appropriate archives
- Update `/journey/` with significant milestones
- Cross-reference with decision records in `/decisions/`
