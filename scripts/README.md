# Utility Scripts

*Created: July 12, 2025 at 2:52 AM UTC*
*Updated: August 1, 2025 - Testing scripts moved to HowTo folder*

This folder contains standalone scripts for maintenance and operations of the Domain Intelligence Platform.

## üìç Note: Testing Scripts Moved
All testing scripts have been relocated to the `/HowTo` folder for better organization. This includes:
- GLEIF testing scripts
- Extraction testing utilities
- System integration tests
- API testing scripts

See `/HowTo/README.md` for complete testing documentation.

## Maintenance Scripts

### **Recovery & Operations**
- **`restart-stuck-batch.js`** - Automated recovery for stalled batch processing
  - Identifies domains stuck in processing state
  - Clears stuck domains back to pending
  - Restarts batch processing automatically

### **Server Management**
- **`start-beta-server.sh`** - Beta server startup with error handling
- **`test-beta-server.js`** - Beta server health checks

## Usage Guidelines

### **Running Scripts**
Most scripts can be executed directly from the project root:
```bash
node scripts/script-name.js
```

For Python scripts:
```bash
python scripts/script-name.py
```

### **Environment Requirements**
- Scripts assume access to production database
- Some require GLEIF API credentials
- Beta testing scripts need beta database access

### **Safety Considerations**
- **`restart-stuck-batch.js`** modifies database state
- Always test on non-production data first
- Review script parameters before execution
- Monitor logs during script execution

## Script Categories

### **Diagnostic Scripts**
Test connectivity, validate configurations, debug issues

### **Recovery Scripts**
Automated fixes for common operational problems

### **Research Scripts**
Exploratory testing for new features and methods

### **Validation Scripts**
Accuracy and performance verification tools

## Integration with Services

Scripts complement the main application services:
- Use same database connections (`server/db.ts`)
- Share storage interfaces (`server/storage.ts`)
- Leverage existing service modules
- Follow same error handling patterns

## Development Notes

When creating new scripts:
1. Add descriptive comments explaining purpose
2. Include error handling and logging
3. Document required parameters
4. Test thoroughly before committing
5. Update this README with script description
