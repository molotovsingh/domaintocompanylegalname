    "Suffixes like S.p.A., S.r.l., or S.r.l.s. are mandatory in the entity’s name to indicate its legal structure, as per the Italian Civil Code.",
    "Trusts are not native to Italy’s civil law system but are recognized under the Hague Convention (ratified in 1990) for international or estate planning purposes; 'Trust' is included in the name.",
    "Foundations ('Fondazione') serve purposes similar to trusts, often for charitable, cultural, or family asset management, and are registered as legal entities.",
    "Nonprofit entities like 'Associazione' are common for community or charitable purposes, similar to Ireland’s unincorporated associations or Brazil’s Associações.",
    "Cooperatives often include 'a r.l.' (responsabilità limitata) in their suffix, e.g., 'Soc. Coop. a r.l.', indicating limited liability.",
    "Public entities, such as state-owned enterprises (e.g., Eni) or universities, lack standardized suffixes and are identified by name or context.",
    "The 'S.r.l.s.' was introduced in 2012 to facilitate startups with simplified requirements and lower capital."
