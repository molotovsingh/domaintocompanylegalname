ooking at the beta server startup and database alignment, here's my analysis:

Beta Server Status
The beta server appears to be in a failed state based on the workflow status, even though it shows successful startup messages. The logs show:

Beta server started successfully on port 3001
Database isolation configured correctly
Health endpoint responding
But workflow marked as "failed"
Database Alignment Issues
1. Schema Consistency ✅
The beta database schema is properly aligned:

betaSchema.ts matches the migration files
Column names are consistent between TypeScript and SQL
Foreign key relationships are correct
2. Database Connection ✅
The beta database connection is properly configured:

Uses separate BETA_DATABASE_URL or fallback to main DATABASE_URL
Drizzle ORM properly initialized with beta schema
Connection isolation maintained
3. Migration State ⚠️
There are multiple migration files that suggest schema evolution:

0002_create_beta_tables.sql - Initial beta tables
0003_enhance_beta_smoke_tests.sql - Enhanced schema
0004_rebuild_beta_tables.sql - Complete rebuild
This indicates the schema may have been rebuilt multiple times, potentially causing inconsistencies.

Server Startup Analysis
Working Components:
Express server initializes correctly
CORS and middleware configured
Health endpoint functional
Database connection established
Experiment initialization working
Potential Issues:
Process Management: The main server tries to manage beta server lifecycle, which may conflict with direct beta server startup
Port Binding: Beta server binds to 0.0.0.0:3001 correctly
Workflow Failure: Despite successful startup logs, the workflow shows "failed" status
Main Server Integration
The main server (routes.ts) has complex beta server management logic:

On-demand startup with health checks
Process cleanup and monitoring
Proxy endpoints to beta server
This dual management approach (workflow + on-demand) may be causing conflicts.

Recommendations Summary
Workflow Conflict: The failed workflow status suggests there may be a process conflict between manual beta server startup and the main server's on-demand management
Database State: Run the latest migration to ensure schema consistency
Process Isolation: Consider using only one method of beta server management (either workflow-based OR on-demand)
Health Check: The beta server appears functional despite workflow failure - the issue may be in process management rather than actual functionality
The core beta server and database are properly aligned, but the startup management system has complexity that may be causing the workflow failure.
