ooking at your Playwright implementation and the broader goal of creating a raw data examination system for LLM assessment, I recommend focusing on both text data AND visual data for a comprehensive approach. Here's why:

Why Both Text and Visual Data Matter
Text Data (Essential Foundation):

Complete HTML content for pattern analysis
All extraction attempts and confidence scores
Meta tags, structured data, headers
Network requests/responses
Processing logs and error details
Visual Data (Critical Context):

Screenshots provide layout understanding that HTML alone can't capture
Visual positioning of company names affects extraction reliability
Logo placement and branding context
Mobile vs desktop rendering differences
Dynamic content that changes after page load
Enhanced Raw Data Structure for Both
Here's how to modify your Playwright extractor to capture comprehensive raw data:

server/betaServices/playwrightExtractor.ts
Enhanced raw data capture with text and visual data, Track all extraction attempts and add raw content, Record structured data extraction attempt, Record meta property extraction attempt, Add comprehensive raw data to return object, Return enhanced raw data structure
This enhanced structure gives you:

Text Data Benefits:
Complete HTML for advanced NLP analysis
All extraction attempts for confidence pattern recognition
Structured metadata for training data generation
Processing context for performance optimization
Visual Data Benefits:
Screenshots for visual ML training
Layout analysis for position-based extraction improvement
Brand recognition training data
Mobile/responsive testing validation
Storage Recommendation
Store this enhanced raw data in your betaSmokeTests table using JSONB:

ALTER TABLE betaSmokeTests 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rawExtractionData JSONB;
This approach gives you both immediate text-based LLM assessment capabilities while building a foundation for future visual AI analysis. The combination provides the most comprehensive dataset for improving your extraction methods.
