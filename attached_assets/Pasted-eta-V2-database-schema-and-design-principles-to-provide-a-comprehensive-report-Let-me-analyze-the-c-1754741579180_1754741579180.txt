eta V2 database schema and design principles to provide a comprehensive report. Let me analyze the current state without making any code changes.

Design Principles Analysis
Based on the documentation and architecture files, Beta V2 follows these key design principles:

1. Federated Microservice Architecture
Each data collection method operates as an independent vertical slice
Zero coupling between collection methods
Complete development isolation
Shared minimal data for cross-method analysis
2. Database Federation Model
Each collection method has its own dedicated database tables
Independent storage strategies per method
No shared schemas between collection methods
Cross-method analysis through minimal shared interfaces
3. Processing Pipeline Separation
Multi-stage processing pipeline (4 stages identified)
Stage isolation with dedicated tables for each processing step
LLM cleaning as a separate, discrete stage
GLEIF integration as final verification stage
Database Schema Investigation Report
Current Schema Structure
The Beta V2 database schema consists of several federated table groups:

Collection Method Tables (Independent Silos)
crawlee_dumps - Advanced web crawling with network capture
scrapy_crawls - Pattern-based extraction results
playwright_dumps - Full browser rendering dumps
axios_cheerio_dumps - Lightweight scraping results (inferred from codebase)
Processing Pipeline Tables
beta_v2_processing_results - Multi-stage processing tracker
cleaned_data - LLM processing results with model comparison
cleaning_sessions - Multi-model comparison tracking
model_performance - LLM model performance metrics
GLEIF Integration Tables
gleif_search_requests - Entity search requests
gleif_candidates_v2 - Enriched GLEIF candidate results
Legacy Beta Tables (Separate isolation)
beta_smoke_tests - Method comparison testing
beta_experiments - Testing experiment tracking
beta_performance_metrics - Performance benchmarking
Schema Issues Identified
1. Inconsistent Federation Implementation
Issue: Not all collection methods have dedicated tables
Evidence: axios_cheerio_dumps table referenced in code but missing schema
Impact: Breaks federation principle, potential data loss
2. Processing Pipeline Schema Gaps
Issue: Missing intermediate processing stages
Evidence: beta_v2_processing_results jumps from stage 1 to stage 4
Expected: Stage 2 (data extraction) and Stage 3 (entity extraction) tables missing
Impact: Cannot track processing failures at intermediate stages
3. Cross-Schema Referential Integrity Problems
Issue: Foreign key relationships span federated boundaries
Evidence: beta_v2_processing_results.source_id references multiple table types
Problem: No database-level constraints possible with federation model
Risk: Data integrity issues, orphaned records
4. Schema Evolution Inconsistencies
Issue: Multiple migration files show schema rebuilds
Evidence: 0004_rebuild_beta_tables.sql indicates previous schema failures
Problem: No clear migration path, potential data loss during transitions
5. Mixed Architectural Patterns
Issue: Legacy centralized tables mixed with federated approach
Evidence: beta_smoke_tests centralizes data that should be federated
Impact: Violates design principle of method independence
Data Flow Architecture Problems
1. Processing Pipeline Bottlenecks
All collection methods funnel through single beta_v2_processing_results table
Creates coupling between independent collection methods
Violates federation principle
2. Cleaning Stage Centralization
LLM cleaning services access all collection method tables
Creates tight coupling between supposedly independent services
Single point of failure for entire processing pipeline
3. GLEIF Integration Coupling
GLEIF search service must understand all collection method schemas
Violates encapsulation of federated services
Recommendations Summary
Immediate Schema Fixes Needed
Create missing axios_cheerio_dumps table schema
Add intermediate processing stage tables (Stage 2, Stage 3)
Implement proper indexing strategy for performance
Add data validation constraints within each federated table
Architectural Alignment Issues
Processing pipeline violates federation principles
Cross-service data access creates coupling
Mixed legacy/modern patterns cause confusion
No clear service boundaries in database design
Long-term Architecture Concerns
Federation model may not be sustainable with current processing pipeline
Consider event-driven architecture instead of shared database access
Implement proper service boundaries with API contracts
Separate read/write concerns for analytics vs operational data
The current schema attempts to implement federation but creates coupling through the processing pipeline, potentially undermining the core design goals of method independence and isolation.
