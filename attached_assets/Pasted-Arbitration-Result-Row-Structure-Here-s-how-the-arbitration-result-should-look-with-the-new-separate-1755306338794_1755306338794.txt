Arbitration Result Row Structure
Here's how the arbitration result should look with the new separated structure:

Sample Arbitration Result for domain: indiatoday.in
{
  // Request metadata
  domain: "indiatoday.in",
  requestId: 29,
  status: "completed",
  
  // What the website claims (for context)
  websiteClaim: {
    entityName: "India Today",
    source: "website_extraction",
    confidence: "high"
    // Note: No LEI - websites can't have LEI by definition
  },

  }
}
Key Changes from Current Structure:
Separated Website Context: The website's claim is shown separately as websiteClaim - not mixed with GLEIF entities
GLEIF-Only Rankings: rankedEntities only contains GLEIF-verified entities with LEI codes
Match Scoring: Each GLEIF entity has a matchScore showing how well it matches the website's claim
Clear Recommendation: A single recommendedEntity field with actionable business insight
No "Claim 0" in Rankings: The website entity is context, not a rankable claim
UI Display Flow:
Top Section: "Website claims to be: India Today" (amber info box)
Results Section: "Best GLEIF Match: TV TODAY NETWORK LIMITED (85% confidence)"
Alternatives Table: Other GLEIF entities ranked by match score
Action Box: Clear recommendation for acquisition research
Does this structure align with what you're looking for? The key insight is that we're not ranking the website's claim against GLEIF entities - we're finding which GLEIF entity best represents what the website claims to be.
