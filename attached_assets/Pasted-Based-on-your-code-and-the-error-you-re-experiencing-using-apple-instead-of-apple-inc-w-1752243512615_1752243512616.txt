Based on your code and the error you're experiencing, using **"apple"** instead of **"apple inc"** would likely **improve your results** and reduce the HTML error you're seeing. Here's why:

## Why "apple" Works Better

### 1. Reduced API Complexity
The GLEIF API handles shorter, simpler search terms more reliably[1]. When you search for "apple" instead of "apple inc", you're:
- Avoiding potential parsing issues with corporate suffixes
- Reducing the chance of triggering HTML error responses
- Making the wildcard search pattern more effective

### 2. Better Wildcard Matching
Your code uses wildcard patterns like `*${encodedTerm}*`. With "apple":
- The search becomes `*apple*` instead of `*apple%20inc*`
- This broader pattern is more likely to match various company name formats
- GLEIF entities might be registered as "Apple Inc.", "Apple Inc", "APPLE INC.", etc.

### 3. GLEIF API Search Behavior
The GLEIF API supports "fuzzy" matching of relevant data fields such as names and addresses[1][2]. A shorter search term like "apple" allows the API to:
- Match multiple variations of the company name
- Find entities with different legal suffixes
- Avoid exact string matching issues

## Expected Results with "apple"

Based on the GLEIF API documentation and your code structure, searching for "apple" should:

1. **Find Apple Inc.** - The main Apple entity with LEI code
2. **Potentially find related entities** - Apple subsidiaries or international entities
3. **Avoid HTML error responses** - Simpler terms are less likely to trigger API errors
4. **Improve confidence scoring** - Your `calculateNameSimilarity` method will work better

## Code Impact Analysis

Your current code already handles this scenario well:

```typescript
// Your enhanced search pattern
if (fuzzy) {
  searchTerm = `*${encodedTerm}*`;  // *apple* vs *apple%20inc*
} else {
  searchTerm = `${encodedTerm}*`;   // apple* vs apple%20inc*
}
```

The shorter "apple" term will:
- Create cleaner URL encoding
- Reduce the likelihood of the "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'..." error
- Allow your progressive search strategy to work more effectively

## Recommendation

**Use "apple" instead of "apple inc"** for these reasons:

1. **Higher success rate** - Less likely to return HTML error pages
2. **Better fuzzy matching** - GLEIF's fuzzy search works better with core terms
3. **More comprehensive results** - May find multiple Apple entities
4. **Cleaner API requests** - Simpler encoding and fewer special characters

Your existing error handling and validation code should catch any remaining issues, and the enhanced entity analysis will help you select the best match from multiple results.
