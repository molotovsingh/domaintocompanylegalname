    "Suffixes like S.R.L., S.A., S.N.C., S.C.S., or S.C.A. are mandatory in the entity’s name to indicate its legal structure under the Companies Law (Law No. 31/1990).",
    "Trusts ('fiducie') were introduced in the Romanian Civil Code (2011) for asset management or estate planning, but they are not legal entities; 'fiducie' or 'trust' is included in the name.",
    "Foundations ('fundație') and associations ('asociație') serve purposes similar to trusts, often for charitable or cultural activities, and are registered as legal entities.",
    "Nonprofit entities like 'asociație' are common for community or charitable purposes, similar to the Czech Republic’s spolek or India’s societies.",
    "Cooperatives are regulated under specific laws, with names often including 'cooperativă' or 'coop'.",
    "Public institutions, such as state-owned enterprises or universities, lack standardized suffixes and are identified by name or context.",
    "Entities are registered with the National Trade Register Office (ONRC), except for certain nonprofits or trusts, which may require additional registrations.",
    "Romania’s civil law system, similar to the Czech Republic or Italy, limits common law trusts, but the 2011 Civil Code introduced the 'fiducie' as a trust-like mechanism."
