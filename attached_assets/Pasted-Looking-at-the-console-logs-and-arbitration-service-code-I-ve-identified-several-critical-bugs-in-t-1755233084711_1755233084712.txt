Looking at the console logs and arbitration service code, I've identified several critical bugs in the arbitration system:

Critical Database Schema Issues
1. Column "pages" Does Not Exist Error
Location: claimsGenerationService.ts and arbitrationRoutes.ts
Problem: The code is trying to query SELECT pages FROM crawlee_dumps but this column doesn't exist in the database schema.

Current Code Issues:

// In claimsGenerationService.ts line ~210
const result = await db.query(
  'SELECT pages FROM crawlee_dumps WHERE id = $1',
  [dump.id]
);
// In arbitrationRoutes.ts line ~396
const dumpResult = await db.query(
  `SELECT pages FROM ${tableName} WHERE id = $1`,
  [dumpId]
);
2. Missing React Key Props
Location: Frontend components in BetaV2DataProcessing.tsx
Problem: Console shows warnings about missing unique "key" props in list rendering.

3. Incorrect Domain Processing
Problem: The arbitration is trying to process https://www.indiatoday.in/ as an entity name instead of extracting the actual company name.

System Status Analysis
‚úÖ Working Systems:

Beta V2 server (port 3001)
Database connections
Perplexity API integration
GLEIF claims generation (3 claims found for India Today)
Arbitration request creation and completion
üîß Active Issues:

Database Schema Mismatch:

crawlee_dumps table missing pages column
Arbitration fails to extract entity data from dumps
Entity Extraction Failure:

Fallback to domain name instead of company name
Results in poor GLEIF matching (0 candidates found)
Frontend Warning Spam:

React key prop warnings flooding console
Vite HMR connection instability
Current Arbitration Flow Issues
From the logs, I can see:

‚úÖ GLEIF claims generation works (found 3 India Today entities)
‚úÖ Arbitration request created (ID: 14)
‚ùå Entity extraction fails due to missing pages column
‚ùå Falls back to domain URL as entity name
‚úÖ Perplexity arbitration completes but with no ranked entities
‚úÖ Results stored successfully
Immediate Impact
The arbitration system is functionally broken for entity extraction but the infrastructure works. The main issue is that it can't extract meaningful company names from dumps, leading to poor arbitration results.

Next Steps Needed:

Fix the database schema mismatch for crawlee_dumps table
Implement proper entity extraction fallbacks
Add missing React keys to eliminate console warnings
Improve error handling for missing data scenarios
The system shows good infrastructure (all services running, APIs responding, database connected) but needs schema alignment and better data extraction logic.
