    "Suffixes like OOO, AO, and PAO are mandatory in the entity’s name to indicate its legal structure under the Russian Civil Code.",
    "Trusts are not native to Russia’s civil law system; 'Doveritelnoe Upravlenie' (trust management) is a contractual arrangement for asset management, not a legal entity.",
    "Foundations ('Fond') serve purposes similar to trusts, often for charitable or cultural activities, and are registered as legal entities.",
    "Nonprofit entities like ANO or Obshchestvennaya Organizatsiya are common for social or charitable purposes, similar to Italy’s Associazioni or Taiwan’s nonprofit organizations.",
    "State institutions and state-owned enterprises (e.g., Gazprom) lack standardized suffixes and are identified by name or context.",
    "Entities are registered with the Federal Tax Service, and suffixes must comply with federal regulations.",
    "The distinction between AO and PAO reflects reforms in 2014, with PAO reserved for public joint-stock companies."
