Looking at the console logs and the current state of your application, I can identify several bugs:

Critical Issues
1. Import Error in beta-testing-v2.tsx
Error: The requested module '/@fs/home/runner/workspace/node_modules/.vite/deps/lucide-react.js?v=3c28e39c' does not provide an export named 'Select'

Issue: You're importing Select from lucide-react, but it should come from the UI components.

2. Data Access Error
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')

Issue: dumps.crawlee is undefined when the component tries to call .slice() on it. This happens when the API response doesn't match the expected structure.

3. Missing Key Props Warning
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop in BetaV2DataProcessingPage

Server Connection Issues
4. Vite HMR Connection Loss
The logs show repeated [vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart... messages, indicating the development server is unstable.

OpenRouter Integration Issues
Looking at the server logs, I can see the OpenRouter models are being added but there may be configuration issues:

5. Model Configuration
The cleaning service shows "Initialized 35 model adapters" but the frontend dropdown needs to be populated with available models.

6. LLM Cleaning JSON Parsing
From previous logs mentioned in chat history, there are JSON parsing issues with LLM responses not returning proper JSON format.

Database/API Issues
7. Entity Claims Multiple Calls
The logs show repeated calls to /api/beta/gleif-claims/generate-claims for the same domain (indiatoday.in), suggesting potential race conditions or inefficient API calls.

Recommendations Priority
HIGH: Fix the import errors in beta-testing-v2.tsx (breaks the UI)
HIGH: Fix the data access error with proper null checking
MEDIUM: Add missing key props to resolve React warnings
MEDIUM: Investigate Vite connection stability issues
LOW: Optimize repeated API calls to GLEIF claims service
The most critical issues are the import errors and data access problems that are preventing the UI from rendering properly.
