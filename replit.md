## Development Learnings
### Federated Service Architecture Patterns (July 24, 2025)
- **Vite Proxy Limitations**: When building federated services on different ports (e.g., beta server on 3001), Vite doesn't automatically proxy these routes
- **Solution Pattern**: Use absolute URLs in frontend code to bypass Vite's proxy and connect directly to the service port
  ```javascript
  // Pattern 1: Protocol-aware absolute URL
  const API_BASE = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.hostname + ':3001/api/beta';
  
  // Pattern 2: Conditional URL based on environment
  const baseUrl = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ? 'http://localhost:3001' : '';
  ```
- **CORS Requirement**: Ensure federated services have CORS enabled (`app.use(cors())`) to allow cross-origin requests
- **Recurring Issues**: Both Playwright Dump and Scrapy Crawl services encountered the same Vite proxy issue - fixed with absolute URLs

### Python Dependency Management (July 24, 2025)
- **Use UV, not pip**: Project uses UV for Python dependency management - add dependencies to `pyproject.toml` and run `uv sync`
- **Python Script Execution**: When executing Python scripts from Node.js, use `uv run python` for proper dependency resolution
- **Error Handling**: Python script output may include warnings before JSON - parse carefully and handle edge cases
- **JSON Response Consistency**: Always wrap Python script execution in try-except blocks that return proper JSON even on errors
